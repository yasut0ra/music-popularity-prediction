# Music Popularity Prediction Competition ðŸŽ¶

This repository contains the materials and code for the **Music Popularity Prediction Competition** conducted as part of a university course in June-July 2024. Our team achieved **1st place** by applying innovative data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict the popularity of songs.

## ðŸ“– Overview

In this competition, teams were tasked with predicting the popularity of songs based on a dataset containing various features (e.g., genre, tempo, duration). We employed advanced techniques and frameworks, outperforming our peers with a combination of careful feature engineering and model tuning.

### Key Features of Our Approach
- **Framework:** Early adoption of XGBoost, an advanced machine learning framework not covered in class.
- **Feature Engineering:** Use of **target encoding** to handle categorical variables effectively.
- **Overfitting Prevention:** Implemented cross-validation and careful parameter tuning to ensure model generalization.
